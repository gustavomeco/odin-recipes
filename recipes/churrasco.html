        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What is a Churrasco? Churrasco is the Brazilian word for barbecue. It's a method of cooking various meats on a purpose-built grill called a "churrasqueira," often with skewers or spits. The term can also refer to a barbecue restaurant or steakhouse. Churrasco is a significant part of Southern Brazilian culture, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and is more than just a meal; it's a social event</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Picanha (Top Sirloin Cap): This is the most iconic churrasco cut. It's recognizable by its triangular shape and a thick layer of fat on one side.</li>
            <li>Fraldinha (Flank Steak): A flavorful, thin cut that cooks relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Maminha (Bottom Sirloin): A tender and juicy cut.e</li>
            <li>Costela (Beef Ribs): These are often cooked for a long time over low heat until the meat is incredibly tender.</li>
            <li>Linguicinha (Pork Sausage): A popular appetizer or side dish.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Fire: </strong>  Build a fire with charcoal. Let it burn down until you have glowing embers and no open flames. Spread the coals evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Season the Meat:</strong> Take a piece of picanha and pat a generous amount of coarse salt onto all sides. Do this right before you put the meat on the grill.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill the Picanha:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the picanha on a skewer, with the fat cap on the outside.</li>
                    <li>Start by placing it on the grill with the fat side down, over a medium-low heat. The goal is to render the fat and create a crispy crust without burning it.</li>
                    <li>Turn the skewer periodically to cook the meat evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cook until your desired doneness. For medium-rare, the cooking time will be relatively short.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong> Slice the meat against the grain and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
